This project is a simple browser based implementation of the classic board game, Go, using HTML5 and JavaScript.

To run: launch [go-h5.html] or [go-txt.html] in your browser.

 * [go-h5.html] is the HTML5 version.
 * [go-txt.html] is a text based version, which also allows you to configure board size.

The plan was also to keep View related files in subfolders, which was done partially for the Touch view, but never completed.

Google Chrome is the only tested browser, although things may work in other browsers as well.
